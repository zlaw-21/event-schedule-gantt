## Introduction
Arcade Music Fest, a newly recurring music festival in Covington, KY, debuted the weekend of August 8th, bringing together local musicians from the Cincinnati area to perform across eight venues along the historic Pike Street corridor. The festival’s official schedule was provided as a static flyer that listed performance times and locations, but its dense layout made it difficult for attendees to quickly compare overlapping sets or plan transitions between venues. This project aimed to transform that unstructured flyer into a clear, minute-level Gantt chart in Excel—delivering a visual schedule that enhanced readability, improved planning, and could be adapted for other multi-venue or time-based events.

## The Problem of *The Flyer*

While the flyer provided strong branding and visual appeal, it lacked utility and readability for Type-A festival goers who wanted to plan their experience in detail. The dense layout made it difficult to quickly compare set times across eight venues, spot potential overlaps, or identify gaps in the schedule. Without an interactive or structured digital version, attendees had no efficient way to organize their time, creating a cognitive load similar to a high-stakes chess endgame where every move must be planned several steps ahead.
